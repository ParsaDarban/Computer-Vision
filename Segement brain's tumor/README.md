We will work on brain tumor detection using several sample images without using learning-based method (machine learning, deep learning).

As we know, medical image processing is one of the most important tasks in computer vision. Image processing for disease detection, such as tumor identification, is challenging without using deep learning and machine learning methods. In this section, we focus solely on using filters to first detect and then locate tumors. This process is part of the preprocessing steps and even algorithms used in image processing and classification.

There is a technique called augmentation used in learning methods to prepare images for feature extraction. However, as mentioned, we will focus solely on analyzing a few MRI images.
